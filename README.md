You have been contracted by the National Park Service to create a program that can track revenue for its parks. Specifically, they would like you to implement the following features:

1. Each park has a unique name and admission price, as well as a way to read that data.
2. Each park can list all the vehicles that entered the park.
3. Each park can list all the passengers that entered the park.
4. Each park can calculate revenue generated. Revenue is generated by charging the admission price per adult that entered the park.

Build upon your existing code from the first two iterations to implement this functionality.
